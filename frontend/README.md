# Muscle.fit - Frontend

This is the frontend scaffold for the Muscle.fit Gym Management UI.

Tech: React, TypeScript, Vite (dev), Tailwind CSS, Lucide React

Next steps:
- Install dependencies: `npm install` from `frontend`
- Start dev server: `npm run dev`

Notes:
- Header component is at `components/layout/Header.tsx`
- Routes are in `routes/AppRoutes.tsx`
- Landing page and card strip are in `pages/public/*`
- The Hero uses `/public/assets/hero.jpg`. Add the final photo (your pasted image) as `frontend/public/assets/hero.jpg`. If the file is missing, the app falls back to `/public/assets/hero.svg` placeholder.
